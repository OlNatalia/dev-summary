# Python

Python is a popular programming language with simple syntax similar to the English language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.     

Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.

Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Python can be treated in a **procedural** way, an **object-oriented** way or a **functional** way.


Python is used for:
- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting

Python can:
- be used on a server to create web applications
- be used alongside software to create workflows
- connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files
- be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development


## Quickstart

```
# check if you have python installed on your OS (which version)
python --version
```
write new file, open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run

```
C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py 
```

### The Python Command Line


```
C:\Users\Your Name>python 
# or
C:\Users\Your Name>py 

print("Hello, World!") 

exit() 
```

## Python Collections (Arrays)

There are 4 collection data types.

4 built-in data types (all with different qualities and usage):
- Lists
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary

The **iterable** can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

## Python Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

- while loops
- for loops
