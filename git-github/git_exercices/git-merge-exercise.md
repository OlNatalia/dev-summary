# Learn git checkout + merge

This is a pair programming exercise (on one computer).
One of you will work on the `master` branch.
One of you will work on a feature branch.
The person working on master begins:

0. Start in your terminal :)

0. Create a new dir (put it someplace useful) and call it 'git-merge-exercise'

0. Create a file called 'go-to-class.md' with the heading '# Go to Class'

0. Add a list in there (remember how to format markdown lists?) with one item: 'Wake up'

0. Commit this file to your repo and include a commit message (may require several commands. Proceed when your git log shows this one commit).

0. Modify your file by adding the list item 'Make sure I have keys'

Your pair-programming buddy takes over:

0. Create a new branch (give it your first name) and checkout the new branch.

0. Add a list item to the file, and list one other step you need to do in the morning before coming to class

0. Commit your work.

Switch partners again:

0. Checkout the master branch

0. Same task again for the other buddy: add a list item to the file naming one thing you need to do in the morning.

0. Commit your work.

Whoever wants to drive for this next part can drive:

0. Merge the new branch into master.

0. Resolve conflicts (keep both changes)

0. Remember to commit to conclude your merge conflict resolution.

0. You're done when your `git log` shows that last commit, and when `git status` shows that your working tree is clean :)

Now swap partners and try that again.

Please reply to this slack thread when you're done :) If you are the last person in the class to reply, react with a sunglasses emoji B)
