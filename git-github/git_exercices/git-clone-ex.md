# Git clone exercise

Start at the same directory for all these exercises:

- Clone your own repo to a dir that has the same name as your GitHub (GH) repo
- Clone a teammate's repo (keep the default name here too, unless you have a naming conflict)
- Clone another teammate's repo to a directory that you choose, using the format:

`git clone <URL> <destination dir>`

Check the dir listing of the person next to you and check that their structure looks great :)

Use `tree` and use ls -a (optionally other flags) to check that you have **no nested repos**
(You may need to `cd` around and check a few places)

Some things to consider:
- How do you show tree for only a certain number of levels?
- Can you see hidden dirs with tree?
